Hello, there. I'm a PhD student from HIT(SZ), advised by Prof. Yuquan Leng. I received my M.S. degree of Electronic Science and Technology from Southern University of Technology and Science in 2025, and B.S. degree of Robot Engineering from University of Technology and Science Beijing in 2022. My research interests include robotics, artificial intelligence, and their applications in assistive devices. 

Research Interests
======
- Robotics: Exoskeletons, Walking Mechanics, and Human-Robot Interaction
- Artificial Intelligence: Robustness, Continual Learning, and Explainability

Selected Publications
