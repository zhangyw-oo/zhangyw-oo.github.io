Wearable devices are currently being used to reduce metabolism and assist people with disabilities for daily walking. For the elderly and disabled people, improving the walking stability of wearable devices is a crucial and unsolved research. In particular, the center of mass (CoM) trajectory can reflect the walking state as well as the stability of a person. For this reason, realizing the prediction of CoM trajectory under daily walking is promising to improve the wearable devices. In this article, a method for estimation and prediction of CoM during daily walking was proposed. A visual-inertial-odometry algorithm was used to obtain history CoM trajectories during walking, and the depth information from camera data was extracted by sequential distance embedding method and encode the information into terrain vectors. The trajectory vectors were patched with the corresponding terrain vectors and then realized the fusion of multi-modal data, which were then fed into a well-trained temporal convolution network to output the prediction results. With data from two outdoor datasets, the method in this paper was verified to be able to be used for CoM trajectory prediction for a variety of walking tasks and consume low computational cost. This method has the potential to be extensible in improving the stability of wearable devices, such as exoskeleton, powered prosthetic, and so on.
